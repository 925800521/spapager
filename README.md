spapager
========

SPA Pager is a JavaScript library that provides a simple imitation of jQuery Mobile's "page" concept.
It is meant for Single Page Applications written in JavaScript and works on mobile devices.

This library has been purposefully kept as lightweight as possible so it can be used in any (mobile) web application without making the project more bulgy.
It is based on jQuery so it would be advisable only to use this library if you’re using jQuery already.
Also, support for CSS3 animations is assumed. REALLY??
